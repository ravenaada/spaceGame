A space-themed game developed using the Pygame library.

## Description 
The Space Game is an exciting and immersive space-themed game developed using the Pygame library. In this game, you take control of a powerful spaceship and embark on a thrilling adventure through the depths of space.

Your mission is to navigate through asteroid fields, dodge enemy fire, and destroy waves of enemy spaceships that are relentlessly attacking. The fate of the galaxy rests in your hands as you battle against increasingly challenging enemies and strive to achieve the highest score possible. The game features different types of ships, lasers, and levels. The player has a limited number of lives, and the game ends if the player loses all lives or their spaceship's health reaches zero.

The Space Game offers an exhilarating space combat experience that will keep you engaged and entertained for hours. Prepare yourself for an epic adventure across the cosmos and show off your piloting skills in this thrilling intergalactic battle.


## Usage 
Follow the instructions below to play the Space Game:
1. Use the WASD keys to move your player spaceship across the screen. Press the 'A' key to move left, the 'D' key to move right, the 'W' key to move up, and the 'S' key to move down.
2. The objective is to shoot down enemy ships while avoiding collisions. Press the spacebar to shoot lasers from your spaceship towards the enemies.
3. Pay attention to your spaceship's health and the number of lives remaining. Your spaceship has a health bar displayed at the top, indicating its current health status. Each collision with an enemy ship or enemy laser reduces your health. If your health reaches zero, you lose a life. You have a limited number of lives, so be careful not to lose them all.
4. Eliminate as many enemy ships as possible to increase your level and score. The game features different types of enemy ships with unique behaviours. Each level introduces new challenges and enemy waves.
5. The game ends if you lose all your lives or if your spaceship's health reaches zero. At the end of the game, you can see your final score.
6. To quit the game, either close the game window or press the 'X' button.
